This example will demonstrate fetching DSpace oai-phm provider which exposes content
using DublinCore metadata format and loading it into a VIVO instance.

You will need to:

- Examine the run-oaifetch.sh (or .bat) script and type the location of the VIVO Harvester installation directory.
- You can uncomment the score and match functions if you want deduplication to be performed (it is turned off by default)
- Modify the vivo.model.xml file to provide parameters for accessing your VIVO web application.
- Shut down your VIVO instance (in order to free the TDB lock)
- Run run-oaifetch.sh (or .bat)
- Restart your VIVO instance and reindex the search indexes
